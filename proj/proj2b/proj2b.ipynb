    "In Project 2 Part A, you made an effort to understand the data through EDA, and did some basic feature engineering. You also built a Logistic Regression model to classify Spam/Ham emails. In Part B, you will learn how to evaluate the classifiers you built. You will also have the chance to improve your model by selecting more features.\n",

If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!\n",

    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better (and/or more) words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
