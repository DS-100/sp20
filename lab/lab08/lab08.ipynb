Based on this, select the best model with the smallest cross validation error out of all the models and hyperparameters we have considered (either lasso regression with its best $\\alpha$ or ridge regression with its best $\\alpha$). Train this model using the **entire training set** and evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.\n",
