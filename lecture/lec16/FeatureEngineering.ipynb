Moreover, all of the earlier transformations (e.g., one-hot encoding and Boolean representations) preserve the information in the feature. In contrast, most of the techniques for encoding text destroy information about the word order and in many cases key parts of the grammar.  \n",

    "1. The n-gram representation is hyper sparse and maintaining the dictionary of possible n-grams can be very costly.  The **hashing trick** is a popular solution to approximate the sparse n-gram encoding.  In the hashing trick each n-gram is mapped to a relatively large (e.g., 32bit) hash-id and the counts are associated with the hash index without saving the n-gram text in a dictionary.  As a consequence, multiple n-grams are treated as the same.\n",
