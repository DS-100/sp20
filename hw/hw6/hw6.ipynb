    "This assignment will continue from where we left off in in Homework 5. Recall that the linear model that you created failed to produce accurate estimates of the observed housing prices because the model was too simple. The goal of this homework is to guide you through the iterative process of specifying, fitting, and analyzing the performance of more complex linear models used to predict prices of houses in Ames, Iowa. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to choose your own features and create your own regression model!\n",
